    singleProjectTitle1: "Shamans",
    singleProjectDesc1: "Shamanism, as an ethnic culture, excites many people, because it contains many philosophical roots and magical (miraculous) principles. It’s no secret that artists are different in their worldview, and shaman culture gives them a rich source of inspiration. Shamans are people who can see spirits, ascend and meet with the deities of Heaven, go down to Hell and fight with demons, sickness and death.Shaman practice associated with primitive magic, however, the difference is that magic is aimed at artificial changes of the world by its will, while the shaman relies on natural forces. In my project, I see them  as demigods and half-shamans. They have equally magic and the ability to control nature. The project «was born» in China with its big variety of antique markets filled with unusual artifacts. It all started with one photo, and then it was no longer possible to stop. Images came, each with their own character and skill. They are evil and kind, they help and they punish - a lot can be listed. Working on this project allowed me to immerse myself in a meditative state, free my thoughts from everyday vanity and give vent to fantasy. I hope that someday these characters will find their place in the book or in the script, as I personally do not have any writing talents.", 
    singleProjectTitle2: "Ukrainian Wreaths",
    singleProjectDesc2: "Ukrainian culture is very ancient and rich with traditions. One of such traditions is weaving wreaths. These wreaths were not just a set of different flowers, they were a code. Each flower carried its own information and meaning, and each set of them could tell you a small story, as they could`ve been made for a special purpose or occasion : wedding wreaths, wreaths for a good luck, birthday wreaths, healing, etc. I wanted to become a part of this, so I wove my own wreaths, and here is result. This series is far from from what I usually do, but why not?",

    aboutPageBio: "I am a photographer from Ukraine, now based in Beijing, China. I'm happy to show you my artworks here. I do fine-art photography, my works are a mixture of classical photography, digital editing, and some particles, that were taken out of dreams. I`ve been working within the photographic field over 10 years. I realized once that ordinary studio photography is not for me, that it`s a bit boring, because I felt that it was just some kind of neverending hunting for the fake emotion. I understood that being able to create your own story, create your own character with unspoking background, and then, using the skills of post-production, materialize it and build your own world - that is really amazing. I make another, dreamlike-reality. Here are no rules, no restrictions. We all live in the wild rhytms of big cities, and in this chaos and continious hurry we`re forgetting about miracles. And what I want to do is just share a part of these miracles and, at least for a moment, try to stop this crazy flow of time, and give somebody a moment to dream for a while. ",

    singleProjectTitle1: "巫师",
    singleProjectDesc1: "作为一种民间文化，巫教（又称“萨满教”）引起了许多人的兴趣，因为巫教蕴藏着各种哲学根源和魔法起源。同时，对很多艺术家而言，巫教文化是一种源源不绝的灵感源泉。巫师是会见神见鬼的人，他们能升到天上来见灵神，也能下到地狱去与魔鬼 、疾病及 死亡斗争。巫教与原始魔法相关，但是魔法主要是使用意念操控自己身边真实事物的变化，而巫教完全靠自然力。本摄影项目的人物都是半神人半巫师。他们既拥有魔法能力，又能控制自然。本艺术项目“诞生”在中国。北京无数的古董市场、奇特的手工艺品都给我带来了很大的启发。本来我只是打算拍一部作品，但是然后就停不下来了。在脑海里不断出现不同的巫师形象，每一个都有各自的性格和能力，善良的或邪恶的、帮助的或惩治的，什么样的都有！创作这一系列作品的过程让我陷入沉思、脱离日常生活中的琐事以及充分发挥自己的想象力。我好像进入了平行世界！我个人没有写作天赋，可是我希望有一天，这些人物都会在一部小说或剧本中得到体现。",
    singleProjectTitle2: "乌克兰传统花圈",
    singleProjectDesc2: "乌克兰有历史悠久和丰富多彩的传统文化。编织花圈头饰是乌克兰最绚丽而美好的传统之一。 这不仅仅是各种花朵的搭配，更是一种编码！每一种花圈都蕴含着某种意义，并用于不同的场合，比如有婚礼花圈、吉祥花圈、生日花圈、以及医疗花圈。我一直很想要接触到这种奇迹，因此亲手编织了几个花圈，而且拍摄了一系列以乌克兰传统花圈为主题的作品 化的喜爱。",
